Play The Game on Itch: https://jemwritescode.itch.io/truck-kun-saves-the-worlds

My submission for my first ever game jam. This is for the GameDev.tv 2022 Jam with the theme "Death is only the beginning". I had a 10 day time limit, so there are bugs and features I wish I had more time to implement. 

## About

This game is based on an anime trope. There is a very popular genre of anime called isekai where characters are sent into another world. It's VERY common for them to be sent to another world by being hit by a truck. If you look up truck-kun you'll see many memes about this trope. For these characters, death is only the beginning as they are propelled into a new world to face the unkown and go on countless adventures!

In this game you play as our ACTUAL hero, Truck-Kun!
